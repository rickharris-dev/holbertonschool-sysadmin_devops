1. I would create a public and private key using ssh-keygen. Use -t to specify
   RSA type encryption. Use -b to specify 4096 bits. Use -C to specify user

2. The public key should be stored on the servers that you plan to connect
   with. The key is added to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server. This
   authenticates the connecting system and the decrypts communication.

3. The private key is added to the ssh-agent to be used for ssh communication.
   If you have more than one key use ssh -i [path to key] to define which to
   use. It encrypts the communication from your system to the server you are
   connecting with.
